<h1>Stacks, substacks and cards</h1>
<br><br>
<h3>Creating and navigating throughout cards </h3>
<p>To create new card go to your stack and press Ctrl+N to create new card. To navigate throughout cards is very simple
    <br><br>
</center>
<p>To go to first card press Ctrl+1
<p>To go to previous card press Ctrl+2
<p>To go to next card press Ctrl+3
<p>To go to last card on your stack press Ctrl+4
<p>To go to recent card press Ctrl+5

<h3>Moving between cards in a standalone app.</h3>
<br>
<p> To move between cards in standalone app you will have to use some really simple codes which are down here so no worries

</center>
<br><br>
<p>Moving to first card
    <br>
<p>on mouseUp
<p>go to first card //Instead of "first" you can type "last" or "next" or "previous" or "recent"
<p>end mouseUp

<br>
<p> Now this is the way i personally use and recomend
<br>
<p>on mouseUp
<p>go to card "here enter name of the card" //you can name the card by double clicking on it and entering name in name field
<p>end mouseUp
<br><br> <br> <center>
