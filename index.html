<h2>Delixa is now Dinixa!!!</h2> <h4>26th April 2022.    Category: Apps and web stuff</h4>
<br>
<p>Just to say on the beginning. This DOES NOT mean that delixa is getting discontinued! It just means that it changed name. But name is not only thing,other apps and services will be named with "Dinixa" in it instead of "www.renatogr.cf". Pros: Its easier to pronounce, less text, sounds better. Cons: none.
  
<br><br>

<h2>Website history</h2> <h4>19th April 2022.    Category: Website stuff</h4>
<br>
<p>So, on 5th May 2021. Domain renatogr.cf was successfully registered on freenom. Few minutes later,i installed Wordpress and one simple looking theme. I also uploaded a ppt i had to make for school and i had it there. Later i changed theme to something "prettyer. It was a classic theme for blogging websites and by that time RedLive (website and app) launched too and i started providng download links to some of my apps. Back then u were able to download Cube app, RedLive and BMI calculator. Also ate that time i showed my website to one of my friends. Later i found one really cool theme and ofcourse i applied it. Few days passed and i noticed website was unreachable so i had to reinstall wordpress and redo the website (that was happening regularly). Then i stopped experimenting with wordpress so i don't have to reainstall it constantly. Website was really active i was constantly adding/removing stuff, there was a dino game, posts, and hyperlinks to other services/pages. But some time later 
  
<br><br>

<h2>Smol update</h2> <h4>13th April 2022.    Category: Website stuff</h4>
<br>
<p>So i did a very very small udate to the website. U probably noticed that i removed snow because, its april.. And i removed thing for RgRAS on the top because it's discontinued and now there is a better way of connecting to my services inside of apps.

<h2>First post in 2022</h2> <h4>1st January 2022.    Category: Randommm</h4>
<br>
<p>Hello world!
  
<br><br>


<h2>Happy new year!!!</h2> <h4>31st December 2021.    Category: Randommm</h4>
<br>
<p>In 52 minutes 2021 is done! Wish you happy new year and lot of happiness! I wish to learn css better and to make this site prettier, get money to buy myself VPS so you won't need to go every few minutes here and take new URL for in app services. But, wishes are just wishes, some will come true some will not.
But it's not time to talk what i want it's time when we all have to be happy and together with people we love! 
And also i added this snow that falls only on this page. Like it? Shhhh, i copy pasted it from spacehey's advent calendar
<p>Again happy new 2022! 
<p>Wow, time flies...
  
<br><br>



<h2>Working online in app services</h2> <h4>31st December 2021.    Category: Apps and web stuff</h4>
<br>
<p>So, i did it. Finallz i have online features in my apps that ACTUALLY WORK! Currently only 2 of my apps support this and they are 1.www.renatogr.cf Desktop and 2.ITM/BMI calculator. 2. is currently in alfa beta beta in dev version and www.renatogr.cf Desktop currently has working store and it has thing that looks how much posts are here. I had to restart www.renatogr.cf Desktop project which means it no longer has ton of broken stuff in it and it no longer uses www.renatogr.cf Server  because they worked in really dumb way but they worked (regr Server and regr Desktop). Desktop app and server were literally sending messages  to each other like desktop ap will send message to server that goes "gimme tile 3" and server will respond "+(text from post 3)" and client app will look if first char of message has  + and if it does than it will put it into field that is made for that. I know really dumb but hey it worked, sort off. But why i scraped regr Server and redone regr Desktop? Because only one client is able to connect to one server and i phisicly can not port forwoard that with my pc and then i just told myself "You are just wasting your time by doing this shit which won't work! Yust do it with http server" And now regr Desktop uses http server (Thats the url on top of the page) it's still in beta (AGAIN) and i will finally be able to publish www.renatogr.cf Desktop 4.0 because older versions 3.x were not able to "log in" withouth server and i told why that's not really possible. So if you want to try out new version of regr Desktop go to apps.regr.cf and find it! Note: If it start to give you errors just go to this page and on top you will se an url just copy it and open regr Desktop open settings and click first thing and there paste url (there is field that is caller URL) If you have any troubles send me e-mail on renato.grubesic@aol.com.

<h2>If you didn't noticed, this website was changed a while ago!</h2> <h4>12th December 2021.    Category: Website stuff</h4>
<br>
<p> So, preview of the new website design was on website <a href="https://demo.renatogr.cf/regrmain.html"> https://demo.renatogr.cf/regrmain.html</a>
<p>In the post under this i said why will i change the website again but i'll say it again. I don't really want
<p>Wordpress because when it decide to update something whole website become unusable. And i wanted to have
<p>website which is completly made by me, so now i write posts in .html files instead of using some post makers
<p>like i did with wordpress.
<p>Yes i know that this is just downgrade but for me website is completly in my hands and i can do anything
<p>at any time without waiting for some plugins to update.
<p> And i also have to tell you i will make the login againg here and it will no longer be working
<p>with Ultimatemember or buddy press. I don't know will old accounts still be avilable but i don't see why they
<p>won't be usable. And also another information, i will rename www.renatogr.cf Apps into www.renatogr.cf Shop
<p>and i will change it's website! That's it i will not leak you anymore informations. 
<p>Byeeeee

<h2>I will change the site... AGAIN</h2> <h4>27th November 2021.    Category: Website stuff</h4>
<br>
<p>So who didn't noticed, this site has wordpress, so since it was made, so I have been planning to start 
<p>this for a long time now. So I'm starting to write html and css for this page, I'll make a segment here now
 <p>where I'll put pictures of what it will look like until I'm done. I have no idea when I will finish it 
 <p>but you will have screen shots so you will see what it looks like. So just to say right away there is no 
<p> chance that I know or manage to write a page like this wordpress theme with all these animations means it 
 <p>will be worse but it will be my work and not someone else's. That's all I wanted to tell you. Byeeeee !!!!!
<br><br>
<h2>Account options are back!</h2> <h4>11th November 2021.    Category: Accounts</h4>
<br>
<p>The options for login, registration and the "wall" on which you can write anything else are returned. 
<p>If you didn't know, all those things were removed, so now they're coming back. 
<p>Groups and private chats should return. ALL ACCOUNTS THAT WERE REGISTERED BEFORE REMOVING THE LOGIN OPTION WERE 
<p>NOT DELETED !!!

<br><br>
<h2>KyK! Shutted down!</h2> <h4>16th September 2021.    Category: Services and boring stuff</h4>
<br>
<p>It’s been half a month since the announcement of the kyk shutdown and it’s passed like a timer on the kyk page. 
<p>So now kyk has been replaced with a delixa website.
<p>
<p>Byeeeeeeeeee

<br><br>
<h2>What end of support mean on my websites/services?</h2> <h4>30th August 2021.    Category: Services and boring stuff</h4>
<br>
[removed content]

<br><br>
<h2>RedLive is near end of life</h2> <h4>29th August 2021.    Category: Services and boring stuff</h4>
<br>
<p>many of you more precisely probably none of you know what RedLive is, I will now briefly explain to you. 
<p>RedLive was intended for Live streaming and posting a variety of videos but unfortunately it never was. 
<p>I gave up on RedLive for a while now and on the red live page there is only one video and the possibility of 
<p>registration and login, AND THAT'S IT. RedLive has never been completed and I don’t believe it ever will be. 
<p>And now, will there be new video sharing services? Of course, a replacement for redlive already exists! 
<p>And it's called www.renatogr.cf Video!
<p>I have been planning this for a long time now and the application www.renatogr.cf Video will be included in regr Desktop


<br><br>
<h2>I'm making some new apps</h2> <h4>22nd August 2021.    Category: Apps stuff</h4>
<br>
<p>You see the title so let me start right away. This page will have an app but don't worry everything will be there will <p>be posts and you will have to have an account on this page but you will be able to create an account in the app as <p>well. The application will have one option that this page will never have and that is codes, so everything will work <p>and it will be typed in the registration of a new account THROUGH THE APPLICATION and if you already have an account <p>you will be able to go to settings add code and type new code. There will also be a code that I hid somewhere 
<p>on the page, which will not always be in the same place, and when you type it, the application with all the current <p>codes and keys will be downloaded, which will work, so when you enter it says to connect to the database on internet <p>where all the codes and keys are, when connected you press to browse the database and below everything will be <p>downloaded and displayed. Oh yes and the name I forgot to say will be called, www.renatogr.cf Desktop. If you have a <p>better suggestion, write in the comments or send it to me in DM (of course here on the site). I'm preparing another <p>application for now, but I won't say anything about it until I put it on. And that both of the apps I mentioned <p>earlier can’t work without the internet. Byeeeeeee

<br><br>
<h2>Idk...</h2> <h4>19th August 2021.    Category: Randommm</h4>
<br>
<p>So it's eleven o'clock and I can't even sleep if you k**l me, you know. And so for an hour, I don't want to fall asleep and I'm writing this now and i will try to sleeeeeep
<p>Byeeee
